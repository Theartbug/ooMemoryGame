# ooMemoryGame

This is the same memory game, but with a different approach: object-oriented programming.

Create card objects programmatically for different levels.
Animate cards with prototypes to flip when clicked, light up when matched, and board game fade away when game ends.
Create a timer that can accept different input in seconds and parse into minutes / seconds that counts down.
Create a score system that rewards each match, subtracts each mis-flip, and add left over time.
Create a best score system using local storage.
